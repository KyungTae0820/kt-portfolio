This is my personal website showcasing my experiences, projects, and skills as a **Computer Science and Computer Informatics student at the University of Southern California (USC).**

- Spearheaded responsive web application with dynamic rendering, routing, and SSR, optimizing meta tags and structured data to boost SEO performance, load speed, and crawlability, reducing LCP by **52% (<2.5s, Google Search Console)**.  
- Utilized **Tailwind CSS** for custom styling and **Node.js** for backend API integration, and deployed the application using **Vercel** for seamless CI/CD.
